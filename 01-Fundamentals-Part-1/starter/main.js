Coding challange #1
 
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
§ Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
§ Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.
GOOD LUCK

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;

const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

const BMIMark = massMark / heightMark ** 2;
const BMIJohn = massJohn / heightMark ** 2;
const markHigherBMI = BMIMark > BMIJohn;

console.log(BMIMark, BMIJohn, markHigherBMI); 

const greet = 'Welcome';
const name = 'Gabor';
console.log(`${greet} ${name}`);
console.log('Regular string...');
console.log('String with \n multiple \n lines');


const age = 15;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log('Sarah can start driving license 🚗');
} else {
  const yearsLeft = 18 - age;
  console.log(`Sarah is too young. Wait another ${yearsLeft} years 😊`);
}


Coding challange #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
Hint: Use an if/else statement 
GOOD LUCK 

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;

const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

const BMIMark = massMark / heightMark ** 2;
const BMIJohn = massJohn / heightMark ** 2;

if (BMIMark > BMIJohn) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${BMIMark}) is higher than John's!`);
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI (${BMIJohn}) is higher than Mark's!`);
}
